Since our last stay, Liz and family have added a bar below the deck.

You can tell that Liz and her family have made some great memories here over the years because they have everything from a fire pit by the water, games to books, and all the cookware and utensils you could ever need in a year-round home. Simply - they thought of everything. Liz is also a very responsive host, texting regularly with pertinent information. Our stay was super relaxing and fun, and we&rsquo;d come back in a heartbeat.

We had four adults and three young kids and the water right outside the door was awesome. We took a short ride to the beach one day, but we preferred to step out on the dock and hop in the water. The ocean on the outer banks is a bit intimidating for young kids, so we appreciated the calm waters of the sound. We rented several things for watersports and the dock provided easy access to all of them. The outdoor shower with hot water was great after a day in the water.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">The house was very comfortable and clean. Kitchen was well appointed. There&#39;s a park grill that we used several times. WIFI was good and a nice TV was available, although we didn&#39;t use it. The views of the sound from inside and outside were great. The neighborhood was nice and quiet.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now that I&#39;ve stayed waterfront on the sound, I prefer it to the beach, especially for the access for watersports and the calm water for the kids.

This was our 4th time renting this home and with all the updates made to the property including new beds, dining room furniture, kitchen cabinetry &amp; deck furniture, the house was even better than our last visit. We have always felt the home&#39;s location, directly on the sound, and being in a quiet neighborhood of Avon, was prefect for us. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed when cooking in and the views from the deck would be hard to beat anywhere on the island. Unfortunately we had to end our stay early due to Hurricane Dorian , but Liz sent us several updates concerning the storm prior to the mandatory evacuation. Her concern and communications prior to our vacation was very much appreciated. We love this home and will be back.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Published Aug 28, 2019</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c10"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Kona Breeze house is terrific</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">5/5</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Stayed Aug 2019</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Andy M.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fantastic sunsets from deck. 2 minutes to beach, restaurants, fishing pier.

We saw stingrays, crabs, and schools of fish, and were able to let our kids swim in the sound (great for days that the beach was too rough). The kitchen was very well stocked and offered everything we needed to cook meals at home. Avon is a lovely town and we hope to make it our home away from home again in the future!

There was plenty of room for our family of 5. Great location for activities and supermarket. Liz and Tim are very thorough so you know exactly how to get in and how everything works. They have a fire pit in the back that we wanted to use but never got the chance. It would be pretty cool hanging out by the fire with the family.

Our only complaint was that there were no screens on the windows, which was really disappointing as the first 2 or 3 nights there were lovely &quot;open windows&quot; type nights. Once the wind died down about the 5th day, we did have bad mosquitoes - my husband killed 8 in one evening in the living room.

If sitting on a deck and digging the view is your thing, then you&#39;ve got choices; a ring side seat on the ground level; a well furnished promenade deck on the main level; and a private balcony box upstairs. If you want to get something or everything wet, its just a few short steps down the private boardwalk to your Pamlico Sound launch pad, complete with a ladder to get you in and out safely. If water toys are on the agenda, there&#39;s a sandy rigging and staging area surrounding the boardwalk, and plenty of room for them (and the cars) under the house.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">The house itself is super comy and well furnished with tastefully modern furniture and appointments throughout. The galley kitchen is well stocked with the right appliances and gadgets to satisfy the chefs and to keep the meals flowing day and night.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Owner Liz is extremely gracious and attentive to all needs and requests, and an able resource for all things Hatteras, just a click away. This not just another house on stilts next to the water, Kona Breeze is a magical portal to the island lifestyle.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Published Nov 5, 2018</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">First visit to outer banks</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">5/5</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Stayed Sep 2018</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Linda A. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">We enjoyed our stay here and really appreciated that linens were included.

The soundfront deck is shaded by the house in the morning and a great place for coffee. Sunsets are amazing and the new Adirondack chairs are incredibly comfortable.

The Konabreeze house hosted all 7 of us adults with ease. Plenty of parking for all the vehicles. 2 outside decks and a shaded seating area on ground level were all used. The private boat dock was used daily. Large kitchen table seated all of us. The on-site washer and dryer also worked out really well. Overall a great experience.

The sunsets are beautiful. It&#39;s close to many beaches. Avon Pier is great. Our favorite beach was the one right outside our door. The owner, Liz was very helpful and always responded to any questions or concerns right away. The beds were quite comfortable with many extra blankets available if needed. There is abundant closet/drawer space available as well. The Wi-Fi and cable were great for the one day it rained, as was the closet full of games and puzzles. Although we did not fish, we saw many fish out at the dock. And the neighbors were pulling in one fish after another. It was a memorable time for us.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Published Oct 5, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Magical!</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">5/5</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Stayed Aug 2017</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Sinead A.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">This house is just wonderful.

We could just relax and enjoy the views of the sound or jump in a kayak, go fishing, take a swim, bike ride, hit the 4wd beaches.... daily ice cream runs and nightly grilling was a must! This was our first trip to Avon and will not be our last! We did hit Ketch 55 for a date night out and loved it so much we went back the following day, kids in tow. The home was perfect for us, we could all space out comfortably and all hang out together easily, the layout really suited us and the linen and cleaning service were a huge plus. We found the kitchen well-equipped and there were plenty of outlets for all our gadgets (I forgot a power strip and didn&#39;t need it anyway!). Plenty of extra linens and little details like clothes hampers in every room made it simple to fall into a routine and keep us going with ease. Loved having the laundry off the first floor bathroom. There are other houses around but spaced out nicely, it was so peaceful. Uglie Mugs coffee shop up the street has something for everyone- strong basic coffee, great iced coffee concoctions and baked goods. The house really felt like a great central location, too. The owners were so easy to work with, very prompt and thorough in communication and so helpful. They emailed great information and advice and also has a backup of important details and resources at the house. I can&#39;t wait to schedule another trip to Kona Breeze!</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Published Jul 3, 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Instant Relaxation and Comfort! &quot;An Older Home with a Fresh Feel&quot;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">5/5</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Stayed May 2017</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Mammy F. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Very Clean.
