The private dock is great for morning coffee or watching the beautiful sunsets. If you like to do any water sports, the access can&rsquo;t be beat. Since our last stay, Liz and family have added a bar below the deck. Great family-friendly place and central location to anything in Avon or Buxton.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Published May 23, 2021</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c14 c4"></span></p><h4 class="c3"><span class="c34 c35 c6">Great property !

We had four adults and three young kids and the water right outside the door was awesome. We took a short ride to the beach one day, but we preferred to step out on the dock and hop in the water. The ocean on the outer banks is a bit intimidating for young kids, so we appreciated the calm waters of the sound. We rented several things for watersports and the dock provided easy access to all of them. The outdoor shower with hot water was great after a day in the water.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c2 c6">The house was very comfortable and clean. Kitchen was well appointed.

This was our 4th time renting this home and with all the updates made to the property including new beds, dining room furniture, kitchen cabinetry &amp; deck furniture, the house was even better than our last visit. We have always felt the home&#39;s location, directly on the sound, and being in a quiet neighborhood of Avon, was prefect for us. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed when cooking in and the views from the deck would be hard to beat anywhere on the island. Unfortunately we had to end our stay early due to Hurricane Dorian , but Liz sent us several updates concerning the storm prior to the mandatory evacuation. Her concern and communications prior to our vacation was very much appreciated. We love this home and will be back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Published Aug 28, 2019</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4 c2 c17"></span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.rbl14lg60o3p"><span class="c34 c35 c6">Kona Breeze house is terrific</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c34 c35 c6">5/5</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Stayed Aug 2019</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Andy M.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c2 c6">Fantastic sunsets from deck. 2 minutes to beach, restaurants, fishing pier.

We saw stingrays, crabs, and schools of fish, and were able to let our kids swim in the sound (great for days that the beach was too rough). The kitchen was very well stocked and offered everything we needed to cook meals at home. Avon is a lovely town and we hope to make it our home away from home again in the future!

It was very clean, beds were comfortable, kitchen well equipped, etc. The view was just lovely, and we enjoyed splashing in the sound, playing cornhole, and sitting around the fire in the evenings. Our only complaint was that there were no screens on the windows, which was really disappointing as the first 2 or 3 nights there were lovely &quot;open windows&quot; type nights. Once the wind died down about the 5th day, we did have bad mosquitoes - my husband killed 8 in one evening in the living room. But overall, a very, very nice place to stay.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Published May 14, 2019</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4 c2 c15"></span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.h6m5jdwf9g8e"><span class="c1 c4">Absolutely wonderful sunsets</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c4">5/5</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Stayed May 2019</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Barry B.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c2 c6">Nice house, nice pier to fish from, Avon Pier just a few blocks down.

If sitting on a deck and digging the view is your thing, then you&#39;ve got choices; a ring side seat on the ground level; a well furnished promenade deck on the main level; and a private balcony box upstairs. If you want to get something or everything wet, its just a few short steps down the private boardwalk to your Pamlico Sound launch pad, complete with a ladder to get you in and out safely. If water toys are on the agenda, there&#39;s a sandy rigging and staging area surrounding the boardwalk, and plenty of room for them (and the cars) under the house.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c2 c6">The house itself is super comy and well furnished with tastefully modern furniture and appointments throughout.

The private boat dock was used daily. Large kitchen table seated all of us. The on-site washer and dryer also worked out really well. Overall a great experience.

We found the kitchen well-equipped and there were plenty of outlets for all our gadgets (I forgot a power strip and didn&#39;t need it anyway!). Plenty of extra linens and little details like clothes hampers in every room made it simple to fall into a routine and keep us going with ease. Loved having the laundry off the first floor bathroom. There are other houses around but spaced out nicely, it was so peaceful. Uglie Mugs coffee shop up the street has something for everyone- strong basic coffee, great iced coffee concoctions and baked goods. The house really felt like a great central location, too. The owners were so easy to work with, very prompt and thorough in communication and so helpful. They emailed great information and advice and also has a backup of important details and resources at the house. I can&#39;t wait to schedule another trip to Kona Breeze!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Published Jul 3, 2017</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4 c2 c15"></span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.qz9ixtoq0e2m"><span class="c1 c4">Instant Relaxation and Comfort! &quot;An Older Home with a Fresh Feel&quot;</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c4">5/5</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Stayed May 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Mammy F. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c2 c6">Very Clean. Older kitchen and bathrooms however does not take away from comfort of the home. Pictures are accurate. The view of sound is outstanding-from the deck(awesome furniture) and entire living area of home! We enjoyed kayaking, finding quiet canals to explore as well as the sound provided easy and more challenging paddling days...Fun! Plus on windy choppy days the living room view provided us with wind surfer entertainment and those awesome waves! Private Dock from property wonderful for sound use. Location 1.25 miles to pier/beach I ran and walked this with ease. Pleasant neighborhoods(and neighbors) to explore on way. Hubby drove to pier always parking available. (And bathrooms!) we did not cook, enjoyed dining out in Avon, Hatteras Village and Rodanthe...all easy drives. Peak at kitchen it looked well supplied. Our first visit to Avon(we have been Duck diehards). Owner provided us with vacation happy info plus all instructions for rental very clear. We will return to Avon and this home will be our rental!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Published May 27, 2017</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4 c2 c15"></span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.qktsrsuo1fpj"><span class="c1 c4">Beautiful Sound Side Retreat</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c34 c35 c6">5/5</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Stayed Apr 2017</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Tony P.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c2 c6">We took a trip to the OBX with my wife, son and parents.

Most beautiful sunsets I&#39;ve ever seen. Very easy house to vacation in. Quickly feels like home. Good name for the house because it was very windy during our couple day stay. Great internet. Can&#39;t wait to come back. Avon is a perfect small american village.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c2 c9">Published Mar 3, 2017</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c4 c2 c15"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c4 c2 c9"></span></p><p class="c33"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 369.33px; height: 517.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 369.33px; height: 517.33px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><div><p class="c33 c12"><span class="c32 c20 c9 c38"></span></p></div></body></html>
